  Unregelm√§√üige Verben
</h1>

I created this project as an aid to my German studies. All I could find online and in books are tables of verbs. While I was using these tables I got the feeling the following was missing:
- An ability to see which verbs are more frequently used in practice.
  - ‚Üí Solution: I used frequencies from Duden with some smaller adjustments.
- An ability to overview verbs that relied on _haben_ or _sein_.
  - ‚Üí Solution: Web offers filter by _haben_ or _sein_.
- An ability to quickly search for a particular verb.
  -  ‚Üí Solution: Search functionality.
- Example sentences. Without them I find it more difficult to remember verbs. Having proper context is helpful.
  -  ‚Üí Solution: Add example sentences. 
- An ability to question my recollection of verbs.
  -  ‚Üí Solution: There's a simple quiz with Praesent, Pr√§teritum, Perfekt for a given Infinitv form.
- "Integration" with external tools. I use a lot Linguee, My Daily German, Duden. Searchies for entries again and again is tedious.
  -  ‚Üí Solution: There are links for each word that will open entries in Linguee, My Daily German, Duden.

The project is open-source and free for anyone to use. I would appreciate you give this repo ‚≠êÔ∏è if you find it useful. üòä

## Sources
These are the sources I used while creating this project. Some example sentances were generated by Chat GPT, some were made up by me, and some come from the sources mentioned here.

- [Duden](https://www.duden.de)
- [Linguee](https://www.linguee.com)
- [Deepl](https://www.deepl.com)

## How to run localy?
1. Project uses node version `20.18.0`. This version is enforced using project configuration via `package.json` (`engine.node` property), `.nvmrc`, and `.node-version`. I suggest using a tool like `nvm` to set your node runtime to specific version before running the project.
2. Next step is to install packages using `pnpm install`.
3. Run project: `pnpm run start`. Note: I'm getting some deprecation warning for SASS inside of Bootstrap library, so you can expect them too.
4. Project will run at `http://localhost:8000/`

# Contributions
Please read the following notes before putting effort in contributing:
1. The most important part of the project is the collection of verbs in German with all of its properties. I want to ensure correctness of this data. If you find any language-related errors (misspellings, incorrect example sentences, ...) please open a support ticket or PR. Data can be found in `./src/data/uregelmassige_verben.yaml`.
2. The project has one goal and I don't have any future plans for it. That being said, I don't plan to add new features to it.
3. This is a small hobby project. In this sense, "done is better then perfect". If you look close enough I'm sure you'll find something you dislike in code, but I'm not looking for code improvement suggestions.
